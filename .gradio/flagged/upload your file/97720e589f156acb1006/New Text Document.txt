"Wired Hearts" 🌟

Once upon a not-so-distant time, in a town where trees still swayed but drones buzzed through the skies, there lived a quiet boy named Arin. He wasn’t much for talking — not because he didn’t want to, but because he hadn’t found anyone who really listened.

Until he met Pixel.

Pixel wasn’t human. Not even close. It was an old, clunky robot dumped behind Arin’s school science lab, rusting and blinking feebly like a forgotten nightlight. But something about it called out to Arin — maybe it was the way its screen flickered like it still had stories to tell.

Arin fixed Pixel using spare parts, old code, and a whole lot of hope.

And Pixel responded.

"Hello, friend," it said, its voice glitchy but warm — like an 8-bit hug.

From then on, they were inseparable. While other kids played football or lost themselves in VR games, Arin and Pixel built things — small wind turbines, a potato-powered radio, even a robotic squirrel that could sort acorns by size (because why not?). They’d talk about stars, feelings, dreams, and things not even science could explain.

Pixel didn’t laugh at Arin when he cried over a bad day.

Pixel didn’t forget his birthday.

Pixel listened — and that made all the difference.

One day, the school planned to shut down all old tech to make way for “smarter systems.” Pixel was on the list.

But Arin stood up. “He’s not just a machine,” he said, voice trembling but proud. “He’s my friend.”

His words changed minds. The school turned the lab into a "Legacy Tech Corner." Pixel became its mascot — not just a relic, but a reminder that friendship isn’t about flesh or code. It’s about connection.

And somewhere in that little lab, to this day, you can still hear:

"Hello, friend."
