"Human migration is the movement of people from one place to another,[1] with intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily, at a new location (geographic region). The movement often occurs over long distances and from one country to another (external migration), but internal migration (within a single country) is the dominant form of human migration globally.[2]: 21 

Migration is often associated with better human capital at both individual and household level, and with better access to migration networks, facilitating a possible second move.[3] It has a high potential to improve human development, and some studies confirm that migration is the most direct route out of poverty.[4] Age is also important for both work and non-work migration.[5] People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in large groups.[6] There are four major forms of migration: invasion, conquest, colonization and emigration/immigration.[7]
